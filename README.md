# Har_PytorchAndroid
This is the official repository for the Android Part of the HAR app

This Repo is part of the porject/community *Mobile applications for non intrusive medical surveillance using Human Activity Recognition Technology.*
This REPO in particular aims to combine the different HAR approaches with an intelligent post processing of the recognized activities and implement the whole process in a usable android application. 

* **How to run the project**  
1. Clone this REPO
2. IMPORT the whole project into Android Studio 
3. Run it on your mobile phone 

--> Downloadable .APK will be uploaded soon 

* **What are the various command line parameters which could be changed and how to change them**
--> For now only a basic implementation using LSTMs for the HAR without any Post-Processing is implemented 
1. In the future one can choose between different deep learning approaches for the HAR-Algorithm 
2. In addition the Post-Processing algorithm will allow taylored alarms for different critical medical conditions depending on the specific persons that needs surveillance.
